# Titanic_Kaggle-project

This ptoject was made for kaggle Titanic competition (link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

The main goal of the competition was to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on information about him or her: for instance sex, age, fare price etc.

The key hint to solve this problem was the feature engeneering that lead to significant imporvments in the prediction model accurancy. Moreover in this project different machine learning models were implemented: from the simple one (like logistic regression) to the ensemble models (like Random Forest Classifier). In addition based on the keras library neural network waas created. It gave an opporunity to compare finale score on the test set between the best machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) and two layers neural network.

The final results were: Random forest classifier -  0.78468, Keras neural network - 0.77990.
